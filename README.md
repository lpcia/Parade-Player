# Parade Player
Arduino based DY-???? MP3 Player with I2CKeyPad input, and a HD44780 LCD Display 
This version works with an automobile headunit/large weatherproof speakers.

## Concept

This is an Arduino Project that lets people interact with a automated display.

## Background
I belong to a G Scale model railroad club that sets up large displays at train shows and local civic events such as a Christmas display at our city museum.  I wanted to make a display / decoration of an old service station that visitors could interact with to play sounds, start animatronics, or turn on lights by pressing a button on a (wired) remote keypad.

I had been toying around with various keypads / mp3 player circuit boards, etc. when a veterans group I belong to finally decided to reactivate an old self-propeled locomotive parade float that had been sitting in a garage for 15 years.  The vehicle is a modified 1938 Nash Laffyeatte built at the Nash plant her in Kenosha, WI.  In order to modernize her, We had to remove 200+ pounds of compressors, tanks, air lines and 80 years of old wiring and automotive electronics from the 1970's.  Instead of using air, I decided to use electronics to play music and sounds and re-engineered my idea into a Parade Locomotive Player.
