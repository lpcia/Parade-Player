# Parade-Player
Arduino based MP3 Player w/ keypad input and HD44780 LCD Display

This is an Arduino Project that I concieved to let people interact with a static display such as pressing buttons to light up and play sounds remotely.  

## Concept

This is an Arduino Project that lets people interact with a static display.

## Background
I belong to a G Scale model railroad club that sets up large displays at train shows and local civic events suck as a Christmas display at our city museum.  I wanted to make a display / decoration such as an old service station that visitors could interact with to play sounds, start animatronics, or turn on lights by pressing a button on a (wired) remote keypad.

I had been toying around with various keypads / mp3 player circuit boards, etc. when the veterans group I belonged to decided to reactivate an old parade float that had been sitting in a garage for 15 years.  We had to remove 200+ pounds of compressors, tanks, air lines and 80 years of old wiring.  Instead of using air, I decided to use electronics to play music and sounds.
